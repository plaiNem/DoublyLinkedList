# Doubly Linked List
Demonstrates the operation of a doubly linked list and implements various methods for it.

I implemented a two-sided list and wrote the basic methods for working with it: 
    - Inserting objects, removing and searching for them
    - Inserting another collection (list, dictionary, queue, etc.)
    - Adding objects, removing and searching for them
    - Adding another collection (list, dictionary, queue, etc.)
    - Sorting the list
    - Displaying list
    - Changing the position of objects in the list vice versa
