# DoublyLinkedList
Demonstrates the operation of a doubly linked list and implements various methods for it.

I implemented a two-sided list and wrote the basic methods for working with it: inserting items, removing and searching for them, inserting another collection (list, dictionary, queue, etc.), sorting the list, displaying it, and changing the position of objects in the list vice versa
