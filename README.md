# Doubly Linked List
Demonstrates the operation of a doubly linked list and implements various methods for it.

I implemented a two-sided list and wrote the basic methods for working with it: 
-inserting objects, removing and searching for them
-inserting another collection (list, dictionary, queue, etc.)
-sorting the list
-displaying list
-changing the position of objects in the list vice versa
